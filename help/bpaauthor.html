      <p> <font size="5"><b>About the Tool</b></font></p>
		<p> The configuration authoring tool was created to simplify the process 
		of constructing and modifying a BPA configuration.&nbsp; The tools 
		simplifies things by indicating what the valid elements and attributes 
		are and how they fit together.&nbsp; It also does some on the fly 
		validation to ensure the file is internally consistent.&nbsp; </p>
      <p> <b><font size="5">Getting Started</font></b></p>
		<p> The tool executable is BPAAuthor.exe.&nbsp; Before using it, that 
		file and all standard BPA libraries should be copied locally to the 
		machine you want to craft configurations with.&nbsp; There is no MSI for 
		this tool.&nbsp; Just run BPAAuthor.exe to start it.&nbsp; No command 
		line options are available.</p>
		<p> The GUI is divided in two major sections: the tree view (on the 
		left) and the editing screens (on the right).&nbsp; The first screen 
		that is shown allows you to create or open a BPA configuration.&nbsp; 
		Once you have a configuration, the tree view will be populated with all 
		the elements in that configuration.&nbsp; As you select nodes in the 
		tree view, the editing screen will change to have the appropriate 
		attributes and values for the currently selected node.&nbsp; You can 
		then use the editing screen to modify the attributes.&nbsp; Each screen 
		has a &quot;Commit Changes&quot; link at the bottom.&nbsp; This will commit any 
		changes you have made to the in-memory copy of the document.&nbsp; You 
		can save all committed changes back to disk using the Save option on the 
		Configuration main menu, or by selecting the root node (which will show 
		you the initial screen again) and selecting the save or save as link.&nbsp; 
		If you attempt to exit the application or open a new configuration with 
		unsaved committed changes, you will be prompted to indicate whether you 
		want to save those changes or not.</p>
		<p> In addition to the two main sections, there is a main menu that 
		contains all the available options at any given time, and a set of 
		controls for searching the document.&nbsp; The text box takes a regular 
		expression and selected next or previous will navigate to the next or 
		previous node in the document that contains any matching data.&nbsp; If 
		no node is selected, this will go from the start or the end, depending 
		on the direction specified.&nbsp; Any data in any attribute on each 
		element may be used to match, including the element and attribute names 
		themselves.</p>
    <div id="nstext3">
      <font size="5"><b>The Main Menu</b></font><p> The options on the main menu 
		are:</p>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Configuration</b>.&nbsp; These menu items control opening and 
			saving configuration files (these controls are also available as 
			links on the main page).</li>
			<li><b>Edit</b>.&nbsp; These menu items are for specific editing 
			functions for the configuration.&nbsp; The actual menu subitems will 
			vary depending on what type of element is selected in the tree view, 
			and they will be the same as the context menu described in the tree 
			view below.</li>
			<li><b>Options</b>.&nbsp; This contains general options controlling 
			the behavior of the tool.&nbsp; This currently contains one option 
			relating to SDM hinting attribute verification.&nbsp; If this is 
			enabled and SDM hinting attributes are not specified on an Object, 
			Setting, or Rule, the tool will prompt the user to let them know 
			this at the time they try to commit the changes.&nbsp; There is more 
			on the SDM hinting attributes below.</li>
			<li><b>Help</b>.&nbsp; This contains an Overview subitem, which will 
			bring up the bpahelp.chm file.</li>
		</ul>
		</div>
    <div id="nstext0">
      <font size="5"><b>The Tree View</b></font><p> Once a configuration has 
		been selected, the tree view will contain all the elements in the 
		configuration, arranged in the same hierarchical fashion that they are 
		in the XML file.&nbsp; Selecting an element will bring up an edit screen 
		appropriate to that element.&nbsp; If you right-click on an element, it 
		will provide you with a list of options that are available.&nbsp; These 
		options will be:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Add &lt;element&gt;</b>.&nbsp; One of these options will exist for 
			every valid type of child element that can be added under the 
			currently selected element.&nbsp; Every element will also have an&nbsp; 
			&quot;Add Custom Element&quot; option to allow you to add any type of element 
			you may want.&nbsp; Such custom elements will be ignored by the BPA 
			engine, but they be accessed with an extension, such as a
			<a href="Schema.ConfigProcessor.html">Configuration Preprocessor</a>.&nbsp; 
			Note: when a new element is added to the configuration, that add 
			will be done to the in-memory document immediately.&nbsp; Even if 
			the &quot;Commit Changes&quot; link is not selected in the edit screen, the 
			newly created element will remain.&nbsp; This can also be selected 
			from the Edit main menu.</li>
			<li><b>Delete</b>.&nbsp; This will exist as long as the element can 
			validly be deleted (the only ones that aren't are the root node and 
			the Configuration element).&nbsp; If chosen, the element and all its 
			child elements will be removed from the in-memory copy of the 
			document.&nbsp; </li>
			<li><b>Cut</b>.&nbsp; This is like delete, but it will also make a 
			copy of the element and all its children in memory.&nbsp; This can 
			also be selected from the Edit main menu or by hitting Shift-Delete 
			or Control-X.</li>
			<li><b>Copy</b>.&nbsp; This will make a copy of the element and all 
			its children in memory.&nbsp; This is also not present on the root 
			or Configuration element because you cannot have more than one of 
			those.&nbsp; This can also be selected from the Edit main menu or by 
			hitting Control-Insert or Cntrl-C.</li>
			<li><b>Paste</b>.&nbsp; This will be present if an element has been 
			previously copied and it is a valid child of the currently selected 
			element.&nbsp; This can also be selected from the Edit main menu or 
			by hitting Shift-Insert or Control-V.</li>
			<li><b>&lt;element&gt; Help</b>.&nbsp; This will be present if a context 
			sensitive help topic exists for the chosen element.&nbsp; It will 
			bring up a help file showing details on what the element means and 
			how it should be defined.&nbsp; This can also be selected from the 
			Edit main menu or by hitting Shift-F1.</li>
			<li><b>Expand all</b>.&nbsp; This will expand the entire tree 
			underneath the currently selected node.&nbsp; Control-E will also do 
			this.</li>
		</ul>
		</div>
    <div id="nstext1">
      <font size="5"><b>The Editing Screens</b></font><p> There will be 
		different screens presented depending on the type of element currently 
		selected in the tree view.&nbsp; There are some common characteristics 
		of these screens:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Comments</b>.&nbsp; Each edit screen starts with a comments 
			section.&nbsp; The data in this text control will actually be saved 
			to an XML comment node immediately preceding the currently selected 
			node.&nbsp; It has no affect on processing.</li>
			<li><b>Attribute fields</b>.&nbsp; All the standard attribute fields 
			will be listed.&nbsp; Several different types of controls are used 
			for this, depending on the possible values of the field.&nbsp; If it 
			is a true/false field, a check box will be used.&nbsp; If it is a 
			free form text field, it will just be a text box.&nbsp; If a 
			specific set of values are valid, it will be a drop down list of 
			values.&nbsp; Note that most of the drop down lists will also be 
			editable so any particular custom values can be added if needed.&nbsp; 
			For all attributes, additional validations and other actions may be 
			taken based on the specific content entered.</li>
			<li><b>Other attributes</b>.&nbsp; Every edit screen also allows 
			other custom attributes to be specified.&nbsp; Like custom elements, 
			these will also be ignored by the engine but they will get passed 
			around appropriately.&nbsp; So - for instance - a custom attribute 
			added to an Object element will be visible to the object processor 
			that is dispatched for that Object.&nbsp; All unrecognized 
			attributes and their values will be listed in this field, and any 
			changes made in this field will be applied after all the standard 
			attribute changes have been applied.&nbsp; This means that if you 
			add a standard attribute to this field, it will override any changes 
			made in the standard field for that attribute.</li>
			<li><b>Commit changes link</b>.&nbsp; This will commit the changes 
			made on the screen to the in-memory document.&nbsp; If you switch 
			off an element without selecting this, all such changes will be 
			lost.&nbsp; Note that committed changes are only made in memory, and 
			not saved to disk until the user elects to.</li>
			<li><b>Advanced attributes</b>.&nbsp; Several screens have an 
			advanced attributes screen containing addition, less-used 
			attributes.</li>
			<li><b>SDM Hinting Attributes</b>.&nbsp; Several screens have SDM 
			Hint Attribute edit screens.&nbsp; These contain hinting attributes 
			that can be specified.&nbsp; These attributes are not used by the 
			BPA engine, but are for future conversion to an SDM document.&nbsp; 
			See <a href="Schema.Object.SDMName.html">SDMName</a>,
			<a href="Schema.Object.SDMMultiplicity.html">SDMMultiplicity</a>,
			<a href="Schema.Object.SDMElement.html">SDMElement</a>, and
			<a href="Schema.Setting.SDMDataType.html">SDMDataType</a> for 
			details.</li>
			<li><b>Substitutions</b>.&nbsp;
			<a href="Schema.Setting.Substitution.html">Substitutions</a> are the 
			BPA equivalent of variable assignments.&nbsp; They are specified on 
			Setting elements, and can then be referenced by all objects below it 
			in the hierarchy.&nbsp; Where applicable, the authoring tool 
			provides a list of substitutions that are in the scope of the 
			currently selected element.&nbsp; You can copy a substitution name 
			out of the list using Control-Insert or Control-C, and then paste 
			them into a text box using standard clipboard commands.&nbsp; When 
			pasted in, the tool will automatically enclose the name in percent 
			signs, which is the standard why they should be referenced.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In addition to the standard controls, some screens have very 
		specialized features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Setting Advanced Attributes: Format and SubstitutionFormat 
			testing</b>.&nbsp; When the &quot;&lt;match&gt;----&lt;replace&gt;&quot; format type is 
			selected, you are then expected to enter a regular expression string 
			to match the appropriate data, and a replacement string to replace 
			it with.&nbsp; <a href="Schema.ExtFormat.html">Formats</a> of the 
			match and replace strings in regular expressions can be found in 
			MSDN.&nbsp; Because these can be somewhat complex, once this has 
			been selected a test button and a text box will be enabled.&nbsp; If 
			you enter a text string and then select the test link, it will alter 
			the string according to the match and replace strings specified.</li>
			<li><b>Rule, Template and Processor Names</b>.&nbsp; These names 
			need to be unique, so if you enter a name that already exists the 
			Commit Changes link will be disabled.</li>
			<li><b>Rule Advanced Attributes: Next EventID assigning</b>.&nbsp; 
			When a configuration is opened, the tool will look for all
			<a href="Schema.Rule.EventID.html">EventID</a> attributes and it 
			will determine what the highest number currently specified is.&nbsp; 
			You can then use the next link to get the next available number to 
			assign to a new EventID.&nbsp; </li>
			<li><b>Rule Advanced Attributes: P vs S parameters</b>.&nbsp;
			<a href="Schema.Rule.Pn.html">Pn</a> and
			<a href="Schema.Rule.Sn.html">Sn</a> attributes are used for passing 
			parameters to rule text, and only one of each value may be 
			specified.&nbsp; So, for example, if P5 has a value, then S5 will be 
			disabled.&nbsp; </li>
			<li><b>Rule Advanced Attributes: Create Template from currently 
			specified attributes link</b>.&nbsp; <a href="Schema.Template.html">
			Templates</a> are used to allow redundant rule properties to be 
			specified in a single place.&nbsp; If you choose to create a 
			template from a given rule, it will create a template with the 
			specified name, copy all the attributes specified for the rule to 
			the template, remove all the rule attributes except for the rule 
			name and the Template value, which will be filled in with the newly 
			created template name.&nbsp; Note: when viewing a rule, any template 
			attributes will automatically be filled in; when saving a rule, it 
			will not save any attributes to the rule that have the same value as 
			the specified template.</li>
			<li><b>Rules</b>.&nbsp; On the rules edit and advanced edit screens, 
			a control similar to the Substitutions list will be supplied that 
			lists all available rules (unlike substitutions, rules are globally 
			accessible, so this will always contain all rules specified in the 
			file).&nbsp; This list also supports Control-Insert or Control-C for 
			copying the rules, and uses the clipboard for pasting them back.&nbsp; 
			However instead of enclosing the rule name in percent signs, it 
			precedes them with dollar signs, which is the appropriate syntax.</li>
			<li><b>Processor and Custom Types</b>.&nbsp; The processor and 
			custom edit screens allow for specifying the actual name of the 
			element as well as the attributes of it.&nbsp; This is only allowed, 
			however, when a new element is created.&nbsp; Once a name as been 
			assigned and committed, further changes are not allowed and the type 
			field will be disabled.</li>
