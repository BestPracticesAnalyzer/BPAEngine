      <p> <b><font size="5">History</font></b></p>
		<p> The best practices analyzer core library was first developed for 
		Exchange, which has an exceedingly complex configuration that spans 
		several different types of data sources and requires very complex rules 
		to validate.&nbsp; Because of the complexity in just dealing with 
		Exchange requirements, the tool (ExBPA) was developed to be very 
		flexible and extensible, which makes it suitable to use as an engine by 
		other products.&nbsp; Development began in early February of 2004 and 
		delivery to the web occurred on September 21, 2004.&nbsp; The 
		development effort involved two full time developers, 2 more part time 
		developers, 2 part time testers, and one full time PM.</p>
		<p> The tool has been well&nbsp;received by customers, support 
		engineers, and the press.&nbsp; It is being incorporated as part of a 
		standard PSS support call.&nbsp; It has already made a number of good 
		catches and as the configuration is enhanced over time its impact will 
		continue to grow.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p> <b><font size="5">Getting Started</font></b></p>
		<p> The Best Practices Analyzer Core Library provides a set of methods 
		that can be used to perform best practices analysis on a specific 
		deployment of a product.&nbsp; The library is comprised of a core 
		engine, a set of common engine extensions, a set of common UI functions, 
		a customizable GUI and command line application, and a full set of 
		documentation on how to tailor it for a specific product's needs.</p>
		<p>There are many ways a product team can use this library to do their 
		own best practices analyses:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Engine only</b>.&nbsp; The engine can be leveraged directly 
			by a product or administrative application and a completely 
			integrated experience can be implemented.</li>
			<li><b>Engine and common UI functions</b>.&nbsp; The common UI 
			functions, when used in conjunction with the engine, can provide a 
			rich set of functionality so individual product teams don't need to 
			reinvent a lot of code.</li>
			<li><b>Engine, common UI, and customizable GUI and command line 
			applications</b>.&nbsp; This leverages the most common code from the 
			library and requires the smallest amount of effort from a product 
			team.&nbsp; It will mean the UI created will have a very similar 
			look and feel to the Exchange Best practices Analyzer, the SQL Best 
			Practices Analyzer, and the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer 
			(these tools all use different technology but have similar looking 
			GUI's).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Note that in all cases the product team will still have to craft the 
		configuration themselves, and this is likely to take some effort.&nbsp; 
		The Exchange configuration contains over 1200 data points and nearly 
		1000 rules and has been crafted over several months with input from many 
		customers, support engineers, and product team members.&nbsp; It 
		continues to evolve as more data comes in from both customers and 
		internal engineers about specific system requirements.&nbsp; Exchange 
		has been adding about 50 rules a month since the product was introduced.</p>
		<p>In addition to the ways product teams can use the code, there are a 
		couple of options for how the code can be delivered to them:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>As external binaries</b>.&nbsp; We will have 
			regular tested drops of this code.&nbsp; There is a Windows Server 
			System Product Studio database that will track bugs and work items 
			for this code.&nbsp; The core BPA team will be responsible for all 
			changes made.&nbsp; </li>
			<li><b>As an open source project</b>.&nbsp; A second option is take 
			delivery of the source code and make changes themselves.&nbsp; When 
			appropriate, such changes should be incorporated back into the core 
			code base.&nbsp; The product team making such changes will be 
			responsible for creating a Product Studio issue to track 
			incorporation of the change, and the core BPA team will be 
			responsible for making the determination whether it should be 
			accepted or not, and then integrating it in if it is.&nbsp; Note: 
			the preferred method would be to use the binaries directly rather 
			then make custom changes to the source code.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This document outlines the specific steps needed for by a product 
		team to take advantage of this code.&nbsp; All questions can be directed 
		to the wssbpa DL.&nbsp; For the latest information, check
		<a href="http://team/sites/wssbpa/default.aspx">

		<p> <font size="5"><b>General </b></font><b><font size="5">Development 
		Steps</font></b></p>
		<p> The exact steps to take depend on what method is chosen for 
		leveraging the BPA library, but this section outlines the basics.&nbsp; </p>
		<p> <u><font size="4">Step 1: Experimenting with the configuration</font></u></p>
		<p> To evaluate the library and determine if it will be useful for a 
		product's needs, the simplest way to start (in addition to reading 
		through this documentation and the video presentations on the web site) 
		is to install our generic test tool (which can be downloaded from
		<a href="file://firebird1/wssbpa/bpa.msi">BPA Configuration Tester - MSI 
		Package</a>) and configuration authoring tool (which is installed from 
		the same package) and begin crafting a configuration.&nbsp; There is a video 
		presentation on the web site that steps you through understanding the 
		configuration, and you can consult the <a href="Schema.html">Schema help</a> 
		for more specific information.&nbsp; This will allow you to get a feel 
		for what the tool can do through direct experience.</p>
		<p> <u><font size="4">Step 2: Taking delivery of the code</font></u></p>
		<p> You will need to determine which delivery method you will be 
		choosing: binaries only or the open source method.&nbsp; If you choose 
		binaries only you should download the files from \\wssbpa\drop\v2.&nbsp; The core BPA team will be responsible for testing and placing new drops at this 
		location, and archiving and backing up previous drops.&nbsp; The drops 
		will not be tested for each product prior to the drop, however - it's up 
		to each product team to test them on their own.&nbsp; The product team 
		is responsible for moving these binaries into their own build system.</p>
		<p> If open source is chosen, on the same drop site a zipped file will 
		also be available containing all the source code and a Visual Studio 
		solution for performing the build.&nbsp; If another build method is 
		required, it is up to the product team to create and maintain it.&nbsp; 
		Any customizations made by the product team that have not been 
		integrated into the core code will have to be reintegrated by the 
		product team with each new source drop they choose to accept.</p>
		<p> <u><font size="4">Step 3: Creating the UI wrappers</font></u></p>
		<p> This step will vary depending on what method the product team has 
		chosen to leverage the core BPA code.&nbsp; If only the engine is being 
		leveraged or if the engine and the common UI code is being leveraged, 
		then the work is all up to the product team at this point.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The engine and common UI interfaces are fully documented in this help 
		document.&nbsp; 
		If the product team will be leveraging the customizable UI, then they 
		just need to take a copy of the main skeleton (this is the BPA project 
		located in the main share), fill in 
		their specifics, and build it.</p>
		<p> <u><font size="4">Step 4: Creating any specialty extensions required</font></u></p>
		<p> While the common extensions that are delivered by the core BPA team 
		cover a wide variety of needs, it may be the case that a product has a 
		particular requirement, such as a new data source, that needs to be 
		developed.&nbsp; See <a href="extensions.html">Extensions</a> for a 
		complete list of the libraries capabilities, as well as a list of extensions that are already 
		available.&nbsp; The core BPA team will assist a product team 
		in such development when it is needed, but the majority of the 
		development effort will be on the product team.</p>
		<p> <u><font size="4">Step 5: Crafting the configuration and detailed 
		content</font></u></p>
		<p> This step should basically be a continuation of the work started in 
		step 1.&nbsp; This process will likely have the following requirements:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>It will take time</b>.&nbsp; Depending on the complexity of 
			the product configuration, this step will take the vast majority of 
			the product team's time and effort.&nbsp; The Exchange configuration 
			took six months to develop the first version, but we were also 
			developing the engine as we were going and were basically starting 
			from scratch instead of working with other engineers with 
			configuration experience.&nbsp; Also, Exchange's configuration needs 
			are likely to be more complex than most other products.&nbsp; Still, 
			expect this to take some time to complete.</li>
			<li><b>It will take domain expertise</b>.&nbsp; While crafting the 
			configuration can be done by developers, testers, support engineers 
			or PM's, to create it correctly and so it is actually useful to 
			customers will require input from the people most experienced with 
			deploying and supporting the product.&nbsp; While using less 
			experienced people may work, the process will be greatly streamlines 
			by using experts directly.&nbsp; The success of the Exchange version 
			is a direct result of the expertise that went into creating the 
			configuration.</li>
			<li><b>It will require a feedback loop</b>.&nbsp; For Exchange, and 
			likely most other products, the deployment expertise does not exist 
			in any one person's head, but in many people, knowledge base 
			articles, white papers, etc.&nbsp; There also likely to be all sorts 
			of interesting and unexpected customer usage scenarios out there.&nbsp; 
			It is therefore important that the configuration be available for as 
			wide an audience to use as possible prior to shipping and channels 
			in place to receive feedback from the beta users and use that 
			feedback to make adjustments and enhancements.&nbsp; The common UI 
			code supports doing auto downloading of configuration changes, which 
			greatly simplifies and speeds up pushing changes back out for more 
			feedback.&nbsp; For Exchange, the tool was delivered early on in the 
			product cycle to support and on-site engineers to use at customers 
			or in test facilities under close observation.&nbsp; This also 
			created a number of &quot;champions&quot; of the tool within the support 
			group, and they later helped evangelize and support the tool itself.&nbsp; 
			After a couple months of that, we also released it to a select group 
			of early adopter customers for their feedback.</li>
			<li><b>It will continue to evolve after shipping</b>.&nbsp; No 
			matter how much work is done up front, specific customer scenarios 
			and additional data gathered through other means, or even product 
			changes themselves will result in best practices needing to be 
			adjusted or enhanced.&nbsp; Changes should continue to take place 
			after the tool is shipped.&nbsp; If the common UI code is leveraged, 
			it will make publishing those changes back out to customers very 
			simple.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In addition to the configuration, it is strongly advised that most 
		issues have detailed articles that accompany them.&nbsp; Without 
		adequate documentation on the issues reported, an analysis tool could 
		create more support calls than it saves.&nbsp; In Exchange, the BPA team 
		worked with the usability and content teams to create several hundred 
		small articles covering most of the issues that it finds.&nbsp; The 
		common UI code provides mechanisms that make it easy to link the issues 
		found to the detailed articles.</p></div>
