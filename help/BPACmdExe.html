      <p> <font size="5"><b>Overview</b></font></p>
		<p>This topic describes the sample command line wrapper that is supplied 
		with the BPA SDK: BPACmd.exe.&nbsp; This wrapper is designed as a code 
		sample only.&nbsp; It is not intended that product teams ship this 
		directly to customers - you should take a snapshot of the code, make any 
		needed customizations, and build it yourself.&nbsp; The purpose of 
		providing a command line version of a BPA application is to allow it to 
		be scripted, enable automated scheduling of the run (this feature is 
		supported by BPA.UserInterface.dll, but it only works if a command line 
		exe exists), and to enable MOM integration (MOM would execute this 
		periodically).&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p> <font size="5"><b>BPACmd.cs</b></font></p>
		<p>This file contains all of the standard code that drives the common 
		command line logic.&nbsp; Most of this file can be used as is<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">.&nbsp; 
		The following are the things that need to be done to customize it for a 
		given implementation:</span></p>
		<ul>
			<li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>BPACmd.Initialize</b>.&nbsp; 
			This method sets the properties in the BPACustomizations class 
			(which is defined in BPA.UserInterface.dll).&nbsp; These properties 
			are used to control the behavior of both the common GUI and the core 
			engine.&nbsp; They are all fully documented within the code 
			comments.&nbsp; There are several strings defined here that should 
			be changed for each individual implementation.&nbsp; There are also 
			a number of flags that control things like whether code and XML 
			files should be verified for proper signing, whether 
			auto-downloading is enabled, etc.&nbsp; Another thing that is 
			controlled here are the custom screen definitions.&nbsp; Custom 
			screens are used to allow you to add your own screens to present to 
			the user to get run time parameters that will affect the run. For 
			more information on how to create these yourself, see the
			<a href="GUIExtensions.Example1.html">Creating a New Selection 
			Screen</a> topic for an example.&nbsp; The BPA sample GUI provides 
			one generic custom screen (described below).</span></li>
			<li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>
			BPACmd.GetBPAScanInfo</b>.&nbsp; This method is called before a scan 
			is run and is meant to handle setting custom information for the 
			run.&nbsp; This would be used to handle processing any special 
			command line parameters and passing them to the run.&nbsp; See the 
			function of the same name in BPA.cs for examples on how to pass run 
			time data to the core engine. </span></li>
			<li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>GenericStrings</b>.&nbsp; 
			This class contains all the strings used by the application that are 
			displayed to users.&nbsp; This is kind of a halfway point towards 
			globalization of the tool.&nbsp; All of these strings should be 
			moved to a resource file to properly globalize the tool, and then 
			they can be localized as required.</span></li>
		</ul>
      <p> <font size="5"><b>Standard Command Line Parameters</b></font></p>
		<p>Here are all the command line parameters currently understood by the 
		core engine (these may be preceded by a dash or slash):</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>-A</b>.&nbsp; This enables the analysis pass to occur for the 
			run.&nbsp; This is on by default if no flags (-C or -E) are 
			specified, and off by default if any one is and this one is not.</li>
			<li><b>-C</b>.&nbsp; This enables the collection pass to occur for 
			the run.&nbsp; This is on by default if no flags (-A or -E) are 
			specified, and off by default if any one is and this one is not.</li>
			<li><b>-CFG &lt;file&gt;</b>.&nbsp; This provides a configuration file to 
			use.&nbsp; It will default to &lt;appname&gt;.Config.xml, in the directory 
			for the appropriate language under the exe directory.</li>
			<li><b>-DAT &lt;file&gt;</b>.&nbsp; This provides a location of where to 
			write the data file to.&nbsp; It will default to &quot;%APPDATA%\Microsoft\&lt;appname&gt;\&lt;appname&gt;.&lt;label 
			or timestamp&gt;.data.xml&quot;.</li>
			<li><b>-DEBUG or -D</b>.&nbsp; This parameter is intended for 
			internal use only.&nbsp; It causes all reported exceptions to 
			include call stacks.</li>
			<li><b>-E</b>.&nbsp; This enables the export pass to occur for the 
			run.&nbsp; This is of by default.&nbsp; This pass is used to remove 
			the contents of any data that has been marked with a NotForExport 
			attribute.</li>
			<li><b>-H or -?</b>.&nbsp; This generates the command line help 
			text.</li>
			<li><b>-IN &lt;file&gt;</b>.&nbsp; This provides a data file to use at the 
			start of a pass.&nbsp; The purposes of this to rerun the analysis 
			pass on an existing data file.&nbsp; This may be done to update it 
			with a newer set of rules, or to translate the output from one 
			language to another.</li>
			<li><b>-L &lt;label&gt;</b>.&nbsp; This is the label to assign to the run.</li>
			<li><b>-MAJOR &lt;number&gt;</b>.&nbsp; This parameter is intended for 
			internal use only.&nbsp; This overrides the major version number of 
			the application.&nbsp; It is used to facilitate auto-download logic 
			testing. </li>
			<li><b>-MINOR &lt;number&gt;</b>.&nbsp; This parameter is intended for 
			internal use only.&nbsp; This overrides the minor version number of 
			the application.&nbsp; It is used to facilitate auto-download logic 
			testing. </li>
			<li><b>-ND</b>.&nbsp; This disables the auto-download logic.</li>
			<li><b>-NOCCS</b>.&nbsp; This parameter is intended for internal use 
			only.&nbsp; This disables verification of signatures in the 
			configuration files.</li>
			<li><b>-P &lt;processor name&gt;:&lt;property&gt;[=&lt;value&gt;][,...] [...]</b>.&nbsp; 
			This allows you to assign values to properties that will get passed 
			into the extension of the given name.</li>
			<li><b>-R &lt;option&gt;[=&lt;value&gt;] [...]</b>.&nbsp; This allows you to 
			specify restrictions and options to apply to the run.</li>
			<li><b>-S</b>.&nbsp; This is used in conjunction with the -UK option 
			to run a previously scheduled BPA scan.&nbsp; It is intended for use 
			with the Windows scheduler, and not for direct use by a user.</li>
			<li><b>-SI &lt;seconds&gt;</b>.&nbsp; This is the save interval time.&nbsp; 
			The engine will automatically save the current output periodically 
			as a safe-storage mechanism in case something goes wrong during the 
			run.&nbsp; Setting this to 0 will disable that logic.</li>
			<li><b>-TH &lt;max number of threads&gt;</b>.&nbsp; This is the maximum 
			number of threads per processor to allow running at one time.&nbsp; 
			This defaults to 25.&nbsp; </li>
			<li><b>-TO &lt;seconds&gt;</b>.&nbsp; This is the default timeout to use 
			for processing any given object.&nbsp; This defaults to 300 seconds.</li>
			<li><b>-TRACE or -T</b>.&nbsp; This parameter is intended for 
			internal use only.&nbsp; It turns on additional tracing messages 
			that can be used for debugging problems.</li>
			<li><b>-U &lt;context name&gt; &lt;domain&gt;\&lt;user&gt; &lt;password&gt;</b>.&nbsp; This 
			provides a list of credentials to apply to the run.&nbsp; Since it 
			requires passwords to be specified in clear text, this is not safe 
			to use.</li>
			<li><b>-UK &lt;user key name&gt;</b>.&nbsp; This is used in conjunction 
			with the -S option to run a previously scheduled BPA scan.&nbsp; It 
			is intended for use with the Windows scheduler, and not for direct 
			use by a user.</li>
		</ul>
      <p> <font size="5"><b>Creating Custom Command Line Parameters</b></font></p>
		<p>These should be parsed before the MainCmd object is created (this is 
		because any command line parameters left over after that completes will 
		cause the run to terminate with an error).&nbsp; You can use the 
		following methods to parse command line parameters yourself:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>CommandLineParameters.ArgumentSet</b>.&nbsp; This tests if a 
			flag is set or not.</li>
			<li><b>CommandLineParameters.GetArgumentValues</b>.&nbsp; This is 
			used to retrieve the value(s) specified for a command line 
			parameter.&nbsp; It will return all the values prior to the next 
			parameter (values and parameters are differentiated because 
			parameters start with a dash or slash and values do not).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These methods can be used by both the command line wrapper and the 
		GUI wrapper.</p>
