      <p> <font size="5"><b>The Provided GUI</b></font></p>
		<p> As part of the BPA library, a complete GUI is provided that just 
		needs to have a few customizations specified in order to be tailored for 
		a particular application.&nbsp; This should save a considerable amount 
		of work and also ensures that different Best Practice Analyzers have the 
		same look and feel to them.&nbsp; In some cases, however, such as if a 
		product wants to integrate the functionality into its admin console or 
		they want the application to have a similar look and feel to the core 
		product, then this code need not be used and the application can be 
		plugged in below in.&nbsp; This, of course, would require more work for 
		the product team.</p>
		<p> This section shows what the standard GUI looks like and where it can 
		be customized.</p>
		<p> <b><font size="5">The GUI Framework</font></b></p>
		<p> The GUI is divided into four major sections: the top panel, the 
		bottom panel, the left panel and the main panel.&nbsp; Here is a screen 
		shot of ExBPA which shows this organization:</p>
		<p> 
		<img border="0" src="bpascreen1.jpg" width="650" height="468"></p>
		<p> The title bar, main title and any other references to the 
		application name can be customized by the application.&nbsp; Some of the 
		left panel navigation links can be disabled and new ones added.&nbsp; 
		The main panel contains the screen controls, and this will change as you 
		navigate from one screen to the next.&nbsp; A standard set of screens is 
		supplied with the GUI:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Download Updates</b>.&nbsp;
			<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">This 
			consists of several screens that will check to see if a newer 
			version of the configuration or binary is found, and give the user 
			the choice of whether to download them or not</span>.&nbsp; These 
			screens can be completely disabled if the application does not want 
			to support auto-update.&nbsp; </li>
			<li><b>Welcome</b>.&nbsp; This screen is shown above.&nbsp; The 
			application can specify what introductory text they want displayed.&nbsp; 
			</li>
			<li><b>Scan In Progress</b>.&nbsp; This will show a scan while it is 
			running, and provide status information so the user can see how far 
			it is.&nbsp; Note that to actually start a scan going requires 
			custom screens to be created that retrieve application specific run 
			time information from the user.&nbsp; More on this below.</li>
			<li><b>View Reports</b>.&nbsp; This provides the user with a number 
			of reporting options for the scan selected (this may be the one just 
			created, or one that was created previously).&nbsp; A number of 
			standard reports are supplied, and an application can enable or 
			disable which ones they wish, as well as define entirely new 
			reports.</li>
			<li><b>Select Scan</b>.&nbsp; This shows a list of scans that have 
			been created so far and allows a user to pick one to view or delete.</li>
			<li><b>Schedule Scan</b>.&nbsp; This allows a scan to be scheduled 
			to run at intervals.&nbsp; Note: a console version must also exist 
			in order to enable this to work.&nbsp; This screen may be disabled 
			if the application doesn't want to support it.</li>
		</ul>
