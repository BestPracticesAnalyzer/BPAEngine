      <p> <font size="5"><b>Overview</b></font></p>
		<p>This topic describes the sample GUI wrapper that is supplied with the 
		BPA SDK: BPA.exe.&nbsp; This wrapper is designed to be used as a test 
		application, a code sample, and for early experimentation with 
		configurations.&nbsp; It is not intended that product teams ship this 
		directly to customers - you should take a snapshot of the code, make any 
		needed customizations, and build it yourself.</p>
      <p> <font size="5"><b>BPA.cs</b></font></p>
		<p>This file contains the majority of the standard code that drives the 
		common GUI.&nbsp; Most of this file can be used as is<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">.&nbsp; 
		The following are the things that need to be done to customize it for a 
		given implementation:</span></p>
		<ul>
			<li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>
			BPA.InitializeCustomizations</b>.&nbsp; This method sets the 
			properties in the BPACustomizations class (which is defined in 
			BPA.UserInterface.dll).&nbsp; These properties are used to control 
			the behavior of both the common GUI and the core engine.&nbsp; They 
			are all fully documented within the code comments.&nbsp; There are 
			several strings defined here that should be changed for each 
			individual implementation.&nbsp; There are also a number of flags 
			that control things like whether code and XML files should be 
			verified for proper signing, whether auto-downloading is enabled, 
			etc.&nbsp; Another thing that is controlled here are the custom 
			screen definitions.&nbsp; Custom screens are used to allow you to 
			add your own screens to present to the user to get run time 
			parameters that will affect the run. For more information on how to 
			create these yourself, see the <a href="GUIExtensions.Example1.html">
			Creating a New Selection Screen</a> topic for an example.&nbsp; The 
			BPA sample GUI provides one generic custom screen (described below).</span></li>
			<li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>BPA.GetBPAScanInfo</b>.&nbsp; 
			This method is called before a scan is run and is meant to handle 
			extracting data from the custom screens and setting that data for 
			the run.&nbsp; This is also described in more detail in the Creating 
			a New Selection Screen topic.</span></li>
			<li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>
			BPARegistrySettings.Initialize</b>.&nbsp; If your application has 
			any special requirements for storing data in the registry, you can 
			do that work in this method (for example, if you want to save off 
			the value of a property ona&nbsp; custom screen so it can be 
			defaulted the next time the application is run).&nbsp; The idea is 
			you would load in the current registry values here and provide 
			accessors for them, and then your custom screens can reference those 
			as needed.</span></li>
			<li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>GenericStrings</b>.&nbsp; 
			This class contains all the strings used by the application that are 
			displayed to users.&nbsp; This is kind of a halfway point towards 
			globalization of the tool.&nbsp; All of these strings should be 
			moved to a resource file to properly globalize the tool, and then 
			they can be localized as required.</span></li>
		</ul>

	<div id="nstext">
      <p> <font size="5"><b>ScanOptions.cs</b></font></p>
		<p>This <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">file contains the 
		code for the sample/test custom screen.&nbsp; While this isn't meant as 
		an end in itself, this screen does provide good sample code as well as 
		something that is very useful from a test perspective.&nbsp; It 
		generates the following fields:</span></p>
		<ul>
			<li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>Label</b>.&nbsp; 
			This is a textbox that allows the user to enter a label for the run.&nbsp; 
			This label is saved in the data file and will show up in the Select 
			Scan screen for that report.</span></li>
			<li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>AD Server</b>.&nbsp; 
			This is a special parameter that will only be displayed if any
			<a href="Extensions.ObjectProcessors.Directory.html">Directory</a> 
			object types exist in the configuration.&nbsp; It identifies the AD 
			server that the AD queries should use by default.</span></li>
			<li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>Substitutions</b>.&nbsp; 
			This will create one textbox for each global
			<a href="Schema.Substitution.html">Substitution</a> found in the 
			configuration.&nbsp; The values entered here will then be passed 
			into the engine at run time.</span></li>
			<li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>Restrictions</b>.&nbsp; 
			This will create one combobox for each
			<a href="Schema.RestrictionType.html">RestrictionType</a> found in 
			the configuration.&nbsp; Each combobox will be populated based on 
			the <a href="Schema.Option.html">Option</a> elements under the 
			RestrictionType.</span></li>
			<li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b>Credentials</b>.&nbsp; 
			This will create three textboxes and a checkbox for prompting for 
			credentials for each unique
			<a href="Schema.Object.SecurityContext.html">SecurityContext</a> 
			value in the configuration.&nbsp; The checkbox determines whether 
			the credentials should be passed in or not, and the textboxes allow 
			for entering the user name, domain, and password.&nbsp; </span></li>
